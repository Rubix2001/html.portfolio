I'm a Language English teacher by profession and have taught in London, Uk, as well as in the Middle-East, Saudi.

I started my journey in Web-design in 2023, taking an online course by Angela Yu which was recommended by a friend on Udemy and have never looked back.

I started with some very basic projects and have managed to develop my skills to being able to design and implement websites with varying complexities.</p>
